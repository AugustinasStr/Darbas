        <p>"I had a lot of people telling me university was the way to go," says Travis Williams, "but with my learning style, working with technology helps me to understand it better."

            Mr Williams is an apprentice at Virgin O2, one of around 740,400 apprentices across England.
            
            For school leavers who don't want to - or can't - go to university, apprenticeships offer an alternative route into many tech companies.
            
            Mr Williams joined Virgin Media O2 as a cyber security apprentice, a year and a half ago. Before that, he got A levels in IT and cyber security at college, and then went on to work at a different college in IT, primarily offering helpdesk support.
            
            Now, Mr Williams is responsible for setting up, maintaining and monitoring security systems at Virgin Media O2, for both network and data centre infrastructure.</p>
