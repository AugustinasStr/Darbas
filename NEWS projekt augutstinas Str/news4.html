        <p>A Suffolk computer expert is predicting that artificial intelligence (AI) will replace human coders in 10 years' time.

            Creative Computing Club founder Matthew Applegate said: "I'm teaching the last generation of coders. We are looking at being knocked out by AI very soon."
            
            Mr Applegate started the club in 2012 with the ethos "50% work 50% play".
            
            "AI will creep into everything; pop music, writing... plumbers are safe! Technology is always an interesting ride," he said.
            
            His prediction comes as a House of Lords committee says that we should embrace the positives of AI rather than just focus on the risks.</p>
