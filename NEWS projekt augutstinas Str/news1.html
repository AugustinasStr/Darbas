        <p>A Russian software company has invited a seven-year-old coding prodigy to join its management team, as soon as he is old enough to take up paid employment.

            Sergey from the Russian city of St Petersburg has built a name for himself, uploading videos that explain how to write software since he was five.
            
            On the strength of those videos, the information security firm Pro32 sent him a written job offer, for the post of head of corporate training.
            
            Under Russian law, Sergey would not be able to take up any paid role until he is 14.</p>
