        <p>A Wiltshire school pupil says he is "proud" to have won a national coding competition.

            Wilf, 10, from Wansdyke Primary School in Devizes, took joint first prize in Discovery Education 2024 Summer Coder Challenge.
            
            He designed a racing game using block coding to earn top prize at the popular computer programming competition for UK schools.
            
            Wilf's teacher Jennifer Murray said: "Block coding has been fantastic for showing the students how their favourite technology is created and having a go for themselves."
            
            "We hope it inspires more future coders, just like Wilf," she added.</p>
