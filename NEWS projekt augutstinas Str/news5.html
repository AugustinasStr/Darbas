        <p>A Polish tech entrepreneur's global project, aimed at getting more children into computer programming, has been endorsed by Pope Francis.

            Miron Mironiuk, founder of artificial intelligence company Cosmose AI, is drawing on his own experience of coding transforming his life.
            
            He said the "Code with Pope" initiative would bridge "the glaring disparities in education" across the globe.
            
            It is hoped the Pope's involvement will attract Catholic countries.
            
            "We believe that the involvement of the Pope will help to convince them to spend some time and use this opportunity to learn programming for free," Mr Mironiuk told the BBC.</p>
