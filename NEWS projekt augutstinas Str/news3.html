        <p>A computer firm has confirmed it was considering plans to list on the London stock market, a move that could value it at a reported Â£500m.

            Cambridge-based Raspberry Pi is known for creating affordable credit card-sized computers designed to boost coding skills among children.
            
            It said it would consider an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange's main market.
            
            If it goes ahead, it could boost London's flagging stock market, which was hit by a swathe of UK-listed firms being bought out or defecting abroad.</p>
