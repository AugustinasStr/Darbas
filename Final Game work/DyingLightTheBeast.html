        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Dying Light: The Beast is a thrilling standalone zombie adventure set in the post-apocalyptic Castor Woods, a once-popular tourist destination. After 13 years of enduring experiments, you escape and hunt down your captors to seek retribution, only to discover there’s far more at stake. While the region is not as populated as it once was, there are still people and factions here, as well as plenty of horrors. Some will ask for your help, others will want to kill you. And that’s not to mention the mysterious creature that’s turned the woods into its personal hunting grounds.

            You are Kyle Crane, the man whose selflessness during the initial virus outbreak saved many from a fate worse than death. After more than a decade in captivity, you find yourself in a world that’s changed, and not for the better. Now, you’ll need to use the survival skills that kept you alive all those years ago to save even more innocent lives.</p>
