        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Two young friends, lost in a frightening world not made for children.
            If they cannot find a way out of this Nowhere place, they’ll be condemned to a fate worse than death.
            
            
            
            You play as Low and Alone, best friends ever since they found each other in this lonely nightmare. They each possess their own iconic item: a bow for Low and a wrench for Alone. Working together, they’ve become adept at sneaking through hidden passages, hoisting each other over massive obstacles, and watching each other’s backs. Whether you’re playing with a friend or an A.I. companion, you’ll depend on each other's iconic items to create opportunities and to progress. The environment is full of clues and possibilities for imaginative children to exploit. Low’s arrows can reach high targets, cut through ropes, or down flying enemies, and Alone’s wrench is just the thing for crushing stunned enemies, smashing through barriers, or manipulating the workings of massive machines.</p>
