        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>From the creators of Contrast and We Happy Few, South of Midnight is a spellbinding third person
            action-adventure game set in the American Deep South.

            As Hazel, you will explore the mythos and encounter creatures of Southern folklore in a macabre and
            fantastical world. When disaster strikes her hometown, Hazel is called to become a Weaver: a magical mender
            of broken bonds and spirits. Imbued with these new abilities, Hazel will confront and subdue dangerous
            creatures, untangle the webs of her own family's shared past and - if she's lucky - find her way to a place
            that feels like home.</p>
