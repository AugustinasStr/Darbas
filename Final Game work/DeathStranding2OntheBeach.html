        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is an upcoming 2025 action-adventure game developed by Kojima Productions and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It is the sequel to Death Stranding, and is written, produced, and directed by Hideo Kojima. It is also the second game of Kojima Productions as an independent entity and the studio's second collaboration with Sony. The title features the previous game's central characters, including Sam Porter Bridges, Fragile, and Higgs, reprised by Norman Reedus, LÃ©a Seydoux, and Troy Baker. They are joined by new characters, Tomorrow (Elle Fanning) and Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna). The game features the likenesses of Mad Max co-creator George Miller and film director Fatih Akin.

            Kojima began writing the game's sequel some time prior to 2020, but reworked his narrative from scratch to reflect the effect of COVID-19 on the worldwide population. After the story was completed, hints of Death Stranding launching a new franchise for Kojima Productions had been insinuated, before the sequel game was confirmed as in development by Reedus in May 2022. The game was officially announced in December 2022 alongside the confirmation of the new cast members' involvement.</p>
