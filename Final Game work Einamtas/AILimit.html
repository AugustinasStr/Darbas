        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Explore the unknown apocalyptic world

            After the sudden yet mysterious collapse of the artificial ecosystem, natural disasters and wars ensued, the
            civilization was wiped out. And in the centuries that followed, a strange substance known as the Mud spread
            everywhere, and monsters emerged.
            You will step into the last city of mankind - Havenswell, exploring cold and damp sewers, layers of slums,
            sky city above the lake, etc., seeking the truth about the destruction of civilization in monster-infested
            ruins. Travel through wonders, face mysterious and deadly enemies, and put an end to an eerie and desperate
            history.

            A journey with a mysterious mission

            Blader has the appearance of human, but it is actually a new life form created by mysterious technology.
            With their own missions, they embark on a lonely and dangerous journey, and with the power of the Branches,
            they respawn after fatal death.
            Now that the Branches have been destroyed, you, as one of the Bladers, will have to search for and repair
            the Branches all over the city. You will meet humans and fellow Bladers who are also in dire straits, feel
            their joys and sorrows, as well as their faith in despair, and together uncover the truth behind the plagues
            and disasters.</p>
