        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>The Celestial Collapse—a calamity caused by a colossal object crashing into the eastern lands known as Azuma. The devastating impact sent fragments of terrain to the skies above and the seas below. With the earth shattered, the power provided by the runes ceased to flow. The gods of nature vanished soon after. Mountains crumbled and fields withered, leaving the people with nothing…not even hope.

            You awaken, startled by a dream of dueling dragons. You don’t remember how or why, but a voice resonates within you.
            
            "Accept the power of an Earth Dancer. Use this power to save the land."
            
            Experience Rune Factory reimagined! Guardians of Azuma is an all-new adventure that takes place in the never-before-seen eastern country of Azuma. Embrace your Earth Dancer powers and fight against the corruption spreading throughout Azuma to bring hope back to this once-prosperous land.</p>
