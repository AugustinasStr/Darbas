        <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Suddenly awakened on a strange primal world filled with dinosaurs and humans struggling for dominance; you must piece together the history of how you arrived there, team-up with legendary heroes, and confront powerful dark forces seeking to control the fate of all life. Saddle up, and join the definitive next-generation survival experience with ARK 2!

        Every aspect of the ARK series has been rethought and redesigned in this sequel. Here's a sampling of the new features that ARK 2 will contain upon its initial Early Access release:
        
        
        Starring Vin Diesel ("Riddick") as legendary ARK hero Santiago, experience an epoch-spanning adventure as he seeks to protect his daughter Meeka -- voiced by Auli'i Cravalho ("Moana") -- from the ghosts of the ancient past and visions of a new future.
        
        
        Fully stackable, user-created Mods for new creatures, items, gameplay features, and maps are now distributed across all platforms, along with support for modded unofficial servers!</p>
