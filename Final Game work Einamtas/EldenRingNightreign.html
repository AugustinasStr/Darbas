        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is an open-world action role-playing game in which the protagonist is controlled from a first-person perspective. Missions and objectives are able to be managed in different ways, with NPCs and communities reacting respectively. In turn, the reactions to the Player character (PC) will influence his daily life and character development.

        Unlike the beginning of its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II does not start with Henry completely inexperienced and untrained. For the first time, the game features crossbows and early forms of firearms. The former can also be fired while riding.[2]
        
        The three skills Oratory, Charisma and Intimidation, that were applicable in dialogues with NPCs in Kingdom Come: Deliverance have been supplemented by Appearance, Coercion and Dominate in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.</p>
