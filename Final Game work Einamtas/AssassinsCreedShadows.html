        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is an upcoming action role-playing game developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by
            Ubisoft. The game is the fourteenth major installment in the Assassin's Creed series and the successor to
            2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage.

            Set in 16th-century Japan towards the end of the Sengoku period, the game will focus on the millennia-old
            struggle between the Assassin Brotherhood, who fight for peace and liberty, and the Templar Order, who
            desire peace through control, from the perspective of two protagonists: Fujibayashi Naoe, a female shinobi,
            and Yasuke, an African samurai inspired by the historical figure of the same name. The two characters
            control differently and provide a unique gameplay style, allowing quests to be approached in multiple ways.
