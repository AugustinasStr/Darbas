        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Classic RTS action meets modern production and performance in Tempest Rising. Inspired by RTS greats of the
            90s and 2000s, Tempest Rising is a classic, base-building real time strategy game set in a modern day
            alternative history war scenario. It features 3 unique factions, each with its own approach to combat and
            economy and offering a variety of strategies for players of all stripes, deep and rewarding gameplay that
            keeps a focus on strategy while rewarding skill, and built-in customization options that allow players to
            approach the game their way in both single player and multiplayer game modes.

            Take on the role of Commander in the highly mobile and advanced peacekeeping corps of the Global Defense
            Forces or the hard-hitting and desperate Tempest Dynasty in 2 11-mission campaigns that allow the player to
            customize their army for each mission, as both armies seek to understand and control the mysterious but
            beneficial Tempest vines that grow unchecked across the war-torn planet Earth. Other dangers wait in the
            shadows, as the origin of the Tempest is revealed...</p>
