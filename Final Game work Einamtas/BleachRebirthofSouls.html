        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>The game is a 1 on 1 3D fighter, with a focus on back-and-forth movement akin to a 2D plane focus, but with
            some minimal walking movement in all directions as both fighters remain consistently locked-on to one
            another.

            Characters can either fight on ground, or end up in standing in midair via generating Reishi on their feet
            as per the source material, causing the inclinations of the plane between the 2 fighters to shift quite
            often.

            The clash of Zanpakuto are at the center of the battle system, sword fights that build in power as you use
            your character’s Zan Ken So Ki, a broad term for Zanpakuto fighting, using Hakuda, Hohô, and Kido, to
            enhance player actions.

            As you attack and defend, you are trying to build enough power to destroy your opponent’s Konpaku with a
            single, decisive blow. This is how victory is achieved in the game.</p>
